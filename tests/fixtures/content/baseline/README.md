# Graph RAG MCP Test Corpus

This folder contains a tiny, deterministic corpus for evaluating MCP tools.

- Use cases: vector search, graph neighbors, backlinks, tags, CRUD.
- Each note includes distinct phrases to avoid ambiguity across embedding models.

See `scripts/run_mcp_evals.py` for automated checks.
