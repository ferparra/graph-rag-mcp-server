id: no-print
message: Avoid print(); use the structured logger instead.
severity: warning # error, warning, info, hint
language: Python
rule:
  pattern: print($A)
note: |
  Direct calls to print() make server logs inconsistent and are hard to test.
  Prefer the project logger (e.g., `logger.info(...)`) or raise typed errors.
# utils: Extract repeated rule as local utility here.
# note: Add detailed explanation for the rule.
